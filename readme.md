##Playing with *"Bleeding edge"* Front End stack

Me playing with technologies and concepts... Most of the code will be documented (at least I'll try) since sole purpose is education...

Server is built in Express and will utilize open movie db API and maybe more similar APIs.

**Note:** did not get to setup React devtools. From what I understood, using it is just a matter of exposing React to window.React and there are tools like [Webpack expose-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expose-loader)

###Stack
