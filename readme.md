##Playing with *"Bleeding edge"* Front End stack

Me playing with technologies and concepts... Most of the code will be documented (at least I'll try) since sole purpose is education...

Server is built in Express and will utilize open movie db API and maybe more similar APIs.

###Stack

Stuff that I am piling up inside this playground

####Frameworks, libraries and stuff

* React
* Falcor
* Express.js
* JADE templating engine (for now - it is plan to remove it and do everything in jsx)

####Build, transpile, compile, compress

* Webpack
* Babel
