##Playing with *"Bleeding edge"* Front End stack

Me playing with technologies and concepts... Most of the code will be documented (at least I'll try) since sole purpose is education...

**Note:** did not get to setup React devtools. From what I understood, using it is just a matter of exposing React to window.React and there are tools like [Webpack expose-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expose-loader)

###Stack

Stuff that I am piling up inside this playground
